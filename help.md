### Softlocks while Loading
This can easily be fixed by opening the developer menu, by pressing the tilde key (~), and
running the following command:
```
loadScene game.scenes.hub.tutorial2.Tutorial2
```
This will teleport you to the Home Island, from where you can go back to the Map

### Getting stuck in loading screen loops
Pasting ``http://www.poptropica.com/base.php?room=FlashpointStart`` or ``http://www.poptropica.com/base.php?room=City2&island=Early`` into a new tab should work.
